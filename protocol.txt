Once the server is ran it waits for the player one on port 2001
"connected" is sent to the first player
The server waits for player 2 to connect on port 2002
"connected" is sent to the second player
"ready" is sent to both players
both players respond "ready"
the game begins with server dealing out cards to both players:
"1: 1S
2: 2H
3: 13C
4: 11D
5: 12S"	
	where: S = Spade, H = Heart, D = Diamond, C = Clube, 1 = Ace, 11 = Jack, 12 = Queen, 13 = King

there are 6 decks of cards the server handles:
player1's draw_deck, discard_deck, refresh_deck
player2's draw_deck, discard_deck, refresh_deck

both players send the massage:
"play"
and the server responds:
"Discard1: 1H (card on discard_deck)
Discard2: 5D
You: 20 (number of cards)
Opponent: 20"

moving refresh_deck's  top_card onto the discard_deck so that both cards are visble
when a player lays down a card on the discard_deck_1 the player sends the message:
"Discard1: 2S"

if the card is correct (in the players hand and incremental or decremental to the current discard_deck card) the server will send to both players: 
"Discard1: 2S
Discard2: 5D
You: 19
Opponent: 20" 

if the card is incorrect the player will send to both players:
"Discard1: 1H
Discard2: 5D
You: 20
Opponent: 20"

Each player will be able to see both the number cards they have and the number their opponent has.

When a player wants to draw a new card the player sends:
"Reqest new card in hand"

If the player's hand is full:
"Full"
else 
"6H"

If there are no moves each player must request:
"Request new card in discard"

The next response from the server will be a new discard message:
"Discard1: 1H
Discard2: 3H
You: ##
Opponent: ##"

The games is won once one player reach 0 before the other.
The Server responds:
"You won"
or 
"Opponenet won"

If both players respond:
"Play again"
The server will reset

If one player responds:
"Exit"
The sever will disconnect both players
